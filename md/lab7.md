## Lab: Choosing a default language


Most user-visible pages in Jira are now internationalized. When Jira is first installed, you can select from the default languages:

```
Chinese
Czech
Danish
Dutch
English (UK or US)
Finnish
French
German
Hungarian
Italian
Japanese
Korean (South Korean)
Norwegian
Polish
Portuguese (Brazilian)

```

The following languages have been discontinued in Jira 8.12. You can still choose them in Jira, but new messages will be in English:

```
Estonian
Icelandic
Romanian
Slovak
```

For all of the following procedures, you must be logged in as a user with the Jira administrators global permission.
