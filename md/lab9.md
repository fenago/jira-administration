Finding your Server ID


The Server ID is an identifier for your Jira instance. When creating a Jira license on my.atlassian.com, you may be prompted to enter the Server ID. You can locate your Server ID on the System info page.

For all of the following procedures, you must be logged in as a user with the Jira system administrator global permissions.

If your license has expired and you cannot find the Server ID, go to Pricing, billing & licensing help and ask to extend your trial.



From the top navigation bar select **Administration** > **System**. 
 
Under the System support (the left-side panel), select System info. The Server ID is displayed in the Jira Info section of the page.


Only admins with global permissions can access System info. If you don't see this section, ask your Jira admins to grant you access or check the Server ID.
